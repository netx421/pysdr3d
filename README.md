🌐 PY-SDR v2.0 - Real-Time Spectrum Visualization Tool

🚀 Welcome to PY-SDR v2.0, a powerful real-time spectrum visualization tool built using PyQt5 and Matplotlib. This application leverages the capabilities of RTL-SDR (Software Defined Radio) to provide a dynamic and interactive representation of radio frequency spectra.

📡 Key Features:

    Real-Time Spectrum Analysis: Capture and analyze radio frequency spectra in real-time with a customizable FFT size.
    3D and 2D Waterfall Views: Visualize the spectrum data in both 3D and 2D waterfall plots for a comprehensive understanding.
    Dark Theme: Enjoy a sleek and modern user interface with a dark theme for extended usage comfort.
    Custom Colormaps: Toggle between standard and high-definition colormaps to enhance visualization.

🔧 Configuration:

    Set your desired RTL-SDR parameters, including sample rate, center frequency, and gain.
    Easily adjust the capture duration, FFT size, and other parameters to suit your needs.

🎨 Custom Colormaps:

    Choose between the vintage_amber_spectrum or custom_reds_high_def colormaps for a personalized viewing experience.

🚨 Usage Instructions:

    Enter the desired frequency (in MHz) in the provided input field.
    Click "Set Frequency" to update the center frequency of RTL-SDR.
    Hit "Start" to commence real-time spectrum capture.
    Toggle "Dark Matter" for a different visual experience.
    Use "Stop" to halt the capture process.

⚙️ Technical Details:

    Developed with PyQt5 for the graphical user interface.
    Utilizes Matplotlib for real-time spectrum visualization.
    Implements multithreading for efficient data capture without freezing the UI.

👩‍💻 How to Use:

    Download and install the required dependencies (PyQt5, Matplotlib, NumPy, rtlsdr).
    Run the PY-SDR v2.0 script and explore the fascinating world of real-time spectrum analysis.
